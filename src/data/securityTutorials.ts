## Step 1: Data Classification and Inventory

### 1.1 Identify Personnel Data Types

**Classify Data Categories:**

**Highly Sensitive (Restricted):**
- Social Security Numbers
- Bank account information
- Medical records
- Background check results
- Disciplinary records

**Sensitive (Confidential):**
- Employee ID numbers
- Salary information
- Performance reviews
- Contact information
- Emergency contacts

**Internal Use:**
- Job titles
- Department assignments
- Work schedules
- Training records

**Public:**
- Employee directory (name, title, department)
- Organizational charts

**Visual Reference:**
*[Image would show data classification matrix with color coding]*

### 1.2 Create Data Inventory

**Document Data Locations:**
```sql
-- Example data inventory query
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    'PII' as classification
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'hr_database'
AND column_name IN ('ssn', 'salary', 'phone', 'address');
```

**Data Inventory Spreadsheet:**
| System | Database | Table | Field | Classification | Encryption Status |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| HRIS | hr_prod | employees | ssn | Restricted | Required |
| HRIS | hr_prod | employees | salary | Confidential | Required |
| HRIS | hr_prod | employees | phone | Sensitive | Recommended |

**Visual Reference:**
*[Image would show data inventory spreadsheet]*

### 1.3 Data Flow Mapping

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON hr_database.employees TO hr_manager;
GRANT SELECT ON hr_database.employees TO hr_specialist;
GRANT SELECT ON hr_database.employee_self_view TO employee_readonly;

-- Create users and assign roles
CREATE USER 'jane.admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'SecurePassword123!';
GRANT hr_admin TO 'jane.admin'@'%';
```

**Row-Level Security:**
```sql
-- Create security policy for managers
CREATE SECURITY POLICY manager_filter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE 
    dbo.fn_manager_access(manager_id) = USER_NAME()
ON dbo.employees
WITH (STATE = ON);

```python
class DataBreachClassifier:
    def classify_incident(self, affected_records, data_types, breach_method):
        severity = "LOW"
        
        # High severity criteria
        if affected_records > 1000 or "SSN" in data_types or "Medical" in data_types:
            severity = "HIGH"
        elif affected_records > 100 or "Salary" in data_types:
            severity = "MEDIUM"
        
        # External breach increases severity
        if breach_method in ["external_attack", "malware", "phishing"]:
            severity = "CRITICAL" if severity == "HIGH" else "HIGH"
        
        return severity

# Automated incident response
def handle_data_breach(incident_details):
    classifier = DataBreachClassifier()
    severity = classifier.classify_incident(
        incident_details['affected_records'],
        incident_details['data_types'],
        incident_details['breach_method']
    )
    
    if severity in ["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]:
        notify_executives()
        notify_legal_team()
        if severity == "CRITICAL":
            notify_authorities()
```

**Breach Notification Templates:**
```html
<!-- Employee Notification Template -->
<div class="breach-notification">
    <h2>Important Security Notice</h2>
    <p>We are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have affected your personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>What Happened</h3>
    <p>{{ incident_description }}</p>
    
    <h3>Information Involved</h3>
    <ul>
        {% for data_type in affected_data_types %}
        <li>{{ data_type }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What We Are Doing</h3>
    <p>{{ remediation_steps }}</p>
    
    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>

        r'Failed login.*admin',       # Brute force
        r'Large data export'          # Data exfiltration
    ]
    
    findings = []
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        for line_num, line in enumerate(f, 1):
            for pattern in suspicious_patterns:
                if re.search(pattern, line, re.IGNORECASE):
                    findings.append({
                        'line': line_num,
                        'timestamp': extract_timestamp(line),
                        'pattern': pattern,
                        'content': line.strip()
                    })
